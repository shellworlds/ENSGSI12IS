# Phase 3: Pilot Production (6-9 Months)

## Objective
Deploy swarm intelligence across automated production line with quality control.

## Deliverables
1. Automated Assembly Line Configuration
2. AI Vision Quality Control System
3. Multi-Unit Swarm Intelligence Deployment
4. Operational Data Collection Framework

## Output Format Standards
- Production metrics: JSON with hourly/daily summaries
- QC images: PNG with defect annotations
- Swarm coordination: CSV with unit communication logs
- Optimization data: JSON with performance improvements

## Validation Protocol
1. Production rate vs. quality trade-off analysis
2. AI vision accuracy validation reports
3. Swarm coordination efficiency metrics
4. Yield improvement tracking
