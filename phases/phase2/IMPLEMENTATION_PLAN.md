# Phase 2: Hardware-in-the-Loop (4-6 Months)

## Objective
Integrate digital prototype with pilot-scale AEM system using verifiable hardware outputs.

## Deliverables
1. HIL Test Bench Configuration
2. Edge Computing Layer Implementation
3. Quantum-Classical Hybrid Controller
4. Optimized Communication Protocols

## Output Format Standards
- Hardware logs: CSV with timestamps and sensor readings
- Control signals: JSON with command-response sequences
- Protocol tests: PCAP/LOG files with timing analysis
- Performance metrics: PNG charts with hardware validation

## Validation Protocol
1. Real-time data capture from pilot system
2. Control signal verification with timing analysis
3. Protocol optimization with latency measurements
4. Hardware-software integration reports
